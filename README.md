## Getting Started

In this repository, $3$ notebooks are available: 

* The notebooks *notebooks/classif_experiments.ipynb* and *notebooks/distances_experiments.ipynb* puprose is to allow the reprodcutibility of the experience of our article.

* The notebook *notebooks/resampling_example.ipynb* illustrates how to use the new strategies introduced in our article.

The folder *oversampling_strategies* contains implementation of the introduced oersampling strategies and seminal ones.

The folder *validation* contains implementation the protocols used for the numerical experiments of our article.
