## Do we need rebalancing strategies? A theoretical and empirical study around SMOTE and its variants.

Repository for [Do we need rebalancing strategies? A theoretical and empirical study around SMOTE and its variants](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03819.pdf) paper.

In praticular, you will find code to reproduce the paper experiments as well as an nice implementation of our *new* and *efficient* strategy for your projects.

## Getting Started

If you want to reproduce our paper experiments:
  - the notebooks [here](notebooks/classif_experiments.ipynb) and [here](notebooks/distances_experiments.ipynb) reproduce the experiments
  - thise [code](./validation) contains implementation the protocols used for the numerical experiments of our article. 

In order to use our MGS strategy:
  - this [notebook](notebooks/resampling_example.ipynb) illustrates how to use it
  - the strategy is implemented [here](./oversampling_strategies/)
